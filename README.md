### 🛠️ Technical Highlights

This project pushes the limits of browser-based interaction, ensuring a high-fidelity experience without sacrificing performance or accessibility.

- **Interactive 3D Environment (Three.js)**
  - **Resource-Efficient Graphics**: Implemented smart throttlers and frame-skipping logic to minimize CPU/GPU overhead during idle states.
  - **High-Precision Interaction**: Utilised **Raycasting** for intuitive object detection, ensuring fluid response to user inputs with zero lag.
- **Predictable Animation System (WAAPI)**
  - **Frame-Accurate Control**: Leveraged the **Web Animation API (WAAPI)** for sub-pixel motion control, ensuring consistent UI states across all browsers.
  - **Main-Thread Optimization**: Orchestrated complex transitions to keep the main thread available for critical data processing and user interactions.
- **Live Performance Observability**
  - **Real-time Health Monitoring**: Integrated a dashboard using the **PerformanceObserver API** to track FPS, LCP, and Jank.
  - **Data-First Optimization**: Demonstrates a commitment to maintaining a strict performance budget even with heavy visual assets.

### 🚀 Engineering Principles

Focused on the core values required in high-stakes environments: Reliability, Scalability, and Clarity.

- **Deterministic UI**: Designing interfaces that remain stable and predictable under high-frequency state updates or network instability.
- **Technical Transparency**: Using **MDX** to transform complex architectural decisions and debugging logs (e.g., RN Bridge issues) into interactive, clear documentation.
- **Clean & Modular Architecture**: Enforced strict type safety and decoupled logic to ensure the codebase remains as robust as a production-level platform.
